Scientists are still trying to establish exactly what happened, when and why, but this was not as sudden as when an asteroid hits Earth.  The Devonian Period had seen the first trees and soils and it had such a diversity of sea life that it’s known as the Age of Fishes, some of them massive and armoured, and, in one of the iconic stages in evolution, some of them moving onto land for the first time.  One of the most important theories for the first stage of this extinction is that the new soils washed into oceans, leading to algal blooms that left the waters without oxygen and suffocated the marine life. \n\nThe image above is an abstract group of the huge, armoured Dunkleosteus fish, lost in the Late Devonian Extinction\n\nWith \n\nJessica Whiteside\nAssociate Professor of Geochemistry in the Department of Ocean and Earth Science at the University of Southampton\n\nDavid Bond\nProfessor of Geology at the University of Hull\n\nAnd\n\nMike Benton\nProfessor of Vertebrate Paleontology at the School of Life Sciences, University of Bristol.","pub_date_ms":1615457700000,"audio":"https://www.listennotes.com/e/p/fcbca1cb18824f7da0727a7fd85def17/","audio_length_sec":2945,"listennotes_url":"https://www.listennotes.com/e/fcbca1cb18824f7da0727a7fd85def17/","image":"https://cdn-images-1.listennotes.com/podcasts/in-our-time-science-bbc-radio-4-czpwGKfCPS2.300x300.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cdn-images-1.listennotes.com/podcasts/in-our-time-science-bbc-radio-4-czpwGKfCPS2.300x300.jpg","maybe_audio_invalid":false,"listennotes_edit_url":"https://www.listennotes.com/e/fcbca1cb18824f7da0727a7fd85def17/#edit","explicit_content":false,"link":"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m000sz7x?utm_source=listennotes.com&utm_campaign=Listen+Notes&utm_medium=website","guid_from_rss":"urn:bbc:podcast:m000sz7x"},{"id":"4773deea03c14a1ca06c830ce0fb15a7","title":"Emilie du Châtelet","description":"Melvyn Bragg and guests discuss one of the outstanding French mathematicians and natural philosophers of the 18th Century, celebrated across Europe.

Total lunar eclipses are more frequent and last longer, with a blood moon coloured red like a sunrise or sunset.

Immediately recognised by his peers, his wider reputation has grown as our reliance on computers has grown.  He was a leading figure at Bletchley Park in the Second World War, using his ideas for cracking enemy codes, work said to have shortened the war by two years and saved millions of lives. That vital work was still secret when Turing was convicted in 1952 for having a sexual relationship with another man for which he was given oestrogen for a year, or chemically castrated. Turing was to kill himself two years later.  The immensity of his contribution to computing was recognised in the 1960s by the creation of the Turing Award, known as the Nobel of computer science, and he is to be the new face on the £50 note.\n\nWith\n\nLeslie Ann Goldberg\nProfessor of Computer Science and Fellow of St Edmund Hall, University of Oxford\n\nSimon Schaffer\nProfessor of the History of Science at the University of Cambridge and Fellow of Darwin College\n\nAnd \n\nAndrew Hodges\nBiographer of Turing and Emeritus Fellow of  Wadham College, Oxford\n\nProducer: Simon Tillotson","pub_date_ms":1602753300001,"audio":"https://www.listennotes.com/e/p/eb0677585e344780b5dd88d5c4247cf2/","audio_length_sec":3188,"listennotes_url":"https://www.listennotes.com/e/eb0677585e344780b5dd88d5c4247cf2/","image":"https://cdn-images-1.listennotes.com/podcasts/in-our-time-science-bbc-radio-4-czpwGKfCPS2.300x300.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cdn-images-1.listennotes.com/podcasts/in-our-time-science-bbc-radio-4-czpwGKfCPS2.300x300.jpg","maybe_audio_invalid":false,"listennotes_edit_url":"https://www.listennotes.com/e/eb0677585e344780b5dd88d5c4247cf2/#edit","explicit_content":false,"link":"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m000ncmw?utm_source=listennotes.com&utm_campaign=Listen+Notes&utm_medium=website","guid_from_rss":"urn:bbc:podcast:m000ncmw"},{"id":"1e17535d8f7349b8bd77c9711ff6de36","title":"Paul Dirac","description":"Melvyn Bragg and guests discuss the theoretical physicist Dirac (1902-1984), whose achievements far exceed his general fame.
