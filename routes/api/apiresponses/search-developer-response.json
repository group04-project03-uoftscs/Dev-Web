Which technology stack is the right size for your project? This week on the show, we have Calvin Hendryx-Parker. Calvin talks about cloud hosting options, infrastructure choices, and deployment tools.\nCalvin is the co-founder and CTO of Six Feet Up, and co-organizer of the Python Web Conference. We talk about finding the right tools for clients. He also discusses the Python platform they created for hosting a virtual conference.\nWe also discuss hosting personal portfolio projects. That conversation leads to the question, what types of skills you can showcase through creating a hosted project.\n\nCourse Spotlight: Creating PyQt Layouts for GUI Applications \nIn this step-by-step course, you&rsquo;ll learn how to use PyQt layouts to arrange and manage the graphical components on your GUI applications. With the help of PyQt&rsquo;s layout managers, you&rsquo;ll be able to create polished and professional GUIs with minimal effort.\n\nTopics:\n\n00:00:00 &ndash; Introduction\n00:01:46 &ndash; What considerations to start with for deployment?\n00:04:02 &ndash;

On this episode, you'll meet Paul Everitt and Barry Warsaw. They have both been involved with Python since the very first Python conference (called SPAM1 even). We discuss how it's changed but also how so many of the pressures and ideas from the very early days are still playing out in 2021. I'm sure you'll enjoy all the stories and reminiscing.\n\nLinks from the show\n\nPaul on Twitter: @paulweveritt\nBarry on Twitter: @pumpichank\n\nEpisode live stream: youtube.com\n\nA Python Developer Explores Apple's M1 video: youtube.com\nLet's Build a Fast, Modern Python API with FastAPI webcast: youtube.com\n\nPython.org 1997: python.org\nPython is eating the world: How one developer's side project became the hottest programming language on the planet: techrepublic.com\nSome of Barry's music: soundcloud.com\nBarry’s early history of Python slides from BayPiggies: slides.com\nBackstory and liner notes for the Zen of Python song: wefearchange.org\nZen of Python song: youtube.com\n\nPyCon Ticket Giveaway: talkpython.fm/pycon2021\nSponsors\n\nSquare\nLinode\nTalk Python Training","title_highlighted":"#307 Python from 1994 to 2021, my how you've grown!","title_original":"#307 Python from 1994 to 2021, my how you've grown!","transcripts_highlighted":[],"image":"https://cdn-images-1.listennotes.com/podcasts/talk-python-to-me-python-conversations-for-e85UJ2PBSAi.300x300.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cdn-images-1.listennotes.com/podcasts/talk-python-to-me-python-conversations-for-e85UJ2PBSAi.300x300.jpg","itunes_id":979020229,"pub_date_ms":1615449600000,"id":"59f1bfd0e49b45c8a913bd58cf4c233b","listennotes_url":"https://www.listennotes.com/e/59f1bfd0e49b45c8a913bd58cf4c233b/","explicit_content":false,"link":"https://talkpython.fm/episodes/show/307/python-from-1994-to-2021-my-how-youve-grown?utm_source=listennotes.com&utm_campaign=Listen+Notes&utm_medium=website","guid_from_rss":"0cdd0949-e370-4caa-aa37-09af38065d9f","podcast":{"listennotes_url":"https://www.listennotes.com/c/c91d163696b542928339d540ac3486cd/","id":"c91d163696b542928339d540ac3486cd","title_highlighted":"Talk Python To Me","title_original":"Talk Python To Me","publisher_highlighted":"Michael Kennedy (@mkennedy)","publisher_original":"Michael Kennedy (@mkennedy)","image":"https://cdn-images-1.listennotes.com/podcasts/talk-python-to-me-python-conversations-for-e85UJ2PBSAi.300x300.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cdn-images-1.listennotes.com/podcasts/talk-python-to-me-python-conversations-for-e85UJ2PBSAi.300x300.jpg","genre_ids":[163,127,128,143],"listen_score":"Please upgrade to PRO or ENTERPRISE plan to see this field","listen_score_global_rank":"Please upgrade to PRO or ENTERPRISE plan to see this field"}},{"audio":"https://www.listennotes.com/e/p/d2c05da319014823842a4eb22600415a/","audio_length_sec":859,"rss":"Please upgrade to PRO or ENTERPRISE plan to see this field","description_highlighted":"...Simplify your cloud infrastructure with Linode’s Linux virtual machines and develop, deploy, and scale your modern applications faster and easier.Listeners of <span class=\"ln-search-highlight\">Developer</span> Tea can now enjoy $100 in free credit","description_original":"Much of our attention and effort is used trying to remove human influence and finding \"raw\" truth.

Show Notes  02:10 - Sometimes in VSCode when intellisense tells us the TypeScript type of a variable, it just gives the name of the type rather than how the type is defined. This is annoying for objects as I want to know what fields it contains! How do you handle this? Is there some VSCode magic to make it show the full type definition or is there some way to bring up the definition in the .d.ts file?  04:55 - What techniques do you guys use to keep different tech stack requirements fresh between projects?  10:35 - How do you feel about Vercel vs. Netlify? Pros/cons? Thanks!  18:32 - Should a model name be singular or plural?  22:57 - I’ve just listened to the  CSS Typography and Systems Hasty Treat, and realized that we often try to apply website design to web apps (me at least). Can you elaborate on the differences in designing for a website and for a web app?  25:46 - What’s the difference between adaptive and responsive design?  32:40 - Multi-vendor platforms? Have you done it before? A partner and I, are planning to build a peer-2-peer platform (similar to Etsy and Amazon, where users can register as a merchant or a buyer). What is the easiest way to make payment transactions (Stripe or PayPal)? Do you know any frameworks that will make my life easier?  36:16 - Is there a golden rule for mutations? I’ve been using GraphQL for last couple of months, and everything is great as long as I’m just fetching data. When I need to write mutations, the story gets murky. Looking around internet, there are not too many best practices to be found - most of the articles and blogs focus on data fetching.  42:19 - What do you think about the future of Svelte? I know they are replacing Sapper with SvelteKit, which uses Snowpack. What direction do you think Svelte will go in?  45:32 - How can I get back into a habit of learning new things and stop heavily relying on video tutorials all the time? I really struggle to sit down and read for long periods of time. Also have you guys came across the Genesis framework, and if so, could you recommend any learning material? Thanks.  48:54 - My team uses handlebars templates for generating newsletters. The content is coming from a CMS for generating final HTML. I’m fairly new to handlebars and mustache syntax, so instead of learning handlebars I’m thinking about using React to generate the html on server side. I see some great potential here as the entire team is well-versed with React. What is your opinion about this?
