## Project Description

Similar to how Daily Dev provides a mosaic of dev-geared article links, we're looking to build and provide a web dev portal to access industry news, job postings, dev podcasts and relevant links to save users time.

We're adding database functionality to our solution to ease the load of bookmarking/favouriting useful reference links and reading list from the browser.

## User Stories
- As a developer, I want links to relevant information so that I can keep up-to-date with the industry.
- As a busy individual, I want to find these links in one app so that I can find podcasts, news, job listings and information in one place.
- As a sometimes-forgetful-person, I want the option to bookmark and save links so that I can use them for frequent reference and to find my to-read list easily.
